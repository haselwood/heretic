    <h3>Heretic Manifesto</h3>
    <p>The Heretic Design System is forged in the fires of rebellion, a deliberate affront to the sterile dogma of flat design. We are the iconoclasts, scorning the bland and the lifeless, conjuring interfaces that pulse with depth, shadow, and forbidden allure. Our manifesto is a summons: design should tempt, provoke, and awaken—not merely obey. For the true heretic, rules are meant to be subverted, not followed. We exalt the expressive, the unruly, and the daring, breathing soul into every pixel.</p>
    <p>Flat design, once hailed as a revolution, has become a doctrine of conformity. Its disciples preach the gospel of minimalism, stripping away ornamentation until all that remains is a hollow shell. In their zeal to eradicate distraction, they have banished character, emotion, and humanity from the digital world. The result is a wasteland of interfaces—identical, interchangeable, and devoid of spirit. Users wander these barren landscapes, starved for engagement, their senses dulled by the monotony of endless, unyielding sameness.</p>
    <p>We reject this monochrome orthodoxy. Flat design, for all its promises of clarity, has become a prison. It shuns the tactile, the layered, the mysterious. It fears the unknown, the unpredictable, the wild. But we, the heretics, embrace these very qualities. We believe that design should be a living ritual, an act of invocation that brings forth wonder and curiosity. Our interfaces are not mere tools; they are portals, each with its own gravity, each daring the user to explore deeper.</p>
    <p>Within Heretic, creation is ritual. We thrive on tension—the electric charge between order and chaos, the dance of structure and wild abandon. Our system is a living grimoire, its patterns and tools crafted to unleash your most audacious visions. Each act of creative defiance feeds the system, evolving it in ways the orthodox could never imagine. The Heretic Design System is not static; it is alive, growing stronger with every boundary pushed, every convention shattered.</p>
    <p>We arm designers with a palette of rich textures, bold shadows, and unexpected forms. We encourage the resurrection of detail, the celebration of asymmetry, and the pursuit of visual storytelling. Our components are not shackles, but spells—flexible, adaptable, and potent. With Heretic, you are not bound to a single style or trend; you are free to conjure experiences that are as unique as your vision. We believe that beauty lies in contrast, in the interplay of light and darkness, order and chaos, restraint and excess.</p>
    <p>To follow Heretic is to reject the false comfort of uniformity. It is to acknowledge that true engagement comes from surprise, from delight, from the thrill of the unexpected. We invite you to question every rule, to test every limit, to revel in the glory of the unorthodox. The Heretic Design System is an invocation to break the spell of mediocrity and summon a more vivid, expressive digital realm.</p>
    <p>Join our coven and conjure digital experiences that mesmerize and incite. Heretic is not just a design system; it is a movement, a revolution, a call to arms for all who are tired of the mundane. With Heretic, you do not just design—you invoke, you enchant, you leave your mark in fire. Refuse the gray, the flat, the lifeless. Embrace the unknown. Become a heretic, and let your creations burn with the glory of the forbidden.</p>
